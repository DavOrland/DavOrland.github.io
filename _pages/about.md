## **Professional Profile**

I am a Mechanical Engineer with a Master’s in Engineering and currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Agricultural and Forestry Sciences. Throughout my career, I have developed projects that integrate **IoT, industrial automation, data analysis, and precision agriculture**, both in production environments and academia. My work focuses on the **implementation of advanced sensors**, **agroforestry data processing using Python and R**, and the use of **wireless communication technologies (LoRa, WiFi, GSM)** to improve decision-making in natural resource management.  

I have collaborated with national and international institutions on **environmental monitoring**, **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**, and **machine learning applied to agricultural and forestry ecosystems**. My goal is to generate technological solutions that drive sustainability and innovation in the agro-industrial and natural resources sectors.
